## Cache Potentially Time-Consuming Computations
## Matrix inversion is a time-consuming costly computation. 
## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and caches its inverse
## Pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set,
             get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getInverse()
        if (!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        mat <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(mat, ...)
        x$setInverse(inv)
        inv
}
